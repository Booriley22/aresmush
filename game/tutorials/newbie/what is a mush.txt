MUSHing blends elements of table-top role-playing games, creative writing, and improvisational acting for a unique online gaming experience.

Like %xhtable-top RPGs%xn, MUSHes have (virtual) character sheets, dice and rules. There is a storyteller/GM helping the story along.

Like %xhcreative writing%xn, MUSHes are fundamentally about telling a story. A MUSH session will read a lot like a chapter in a novel. The players are the authors in this collaborative tale.

Like %xhimprovisational acting%xn, MUSHes are live and //without a script//. The story develops on-screen in more-or-less real time. You take on the role of your character in a more immersive way.

MUSHing is all about telling a story.  A good analogy is to think of it like a collaborative television series, with each actor (or player, in this case) scripting the actions and dialog of their character as they go along.
