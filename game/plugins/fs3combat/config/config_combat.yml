    combatant_types:
        # For each combatant type, you can specify their starting weapon, armor and
        # vehicle type.  All of this can be changed by the player once they're in combat
        # if for some reason it doesn't apply.
        #
        # You can also specify whether this type is included in auto-targeting by NPCs.
        # Typically you would set this to 'false' for passengers in vehicles (because the 
        # pilot should be targeted instead), or observers.
