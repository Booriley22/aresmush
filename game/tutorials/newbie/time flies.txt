Time is an interesting concept on a MUSH, because the game is running 24/7. On a macro level, most games operate at a 1:1 time ratio compared to real life. That means that for every day that passes in the real world, a day passes in the in-game world as well. If you want your character to have a baby, you’re going to have to wait 9 real life months. It’s a good thing that MUSHes, like soap operas, can last for years!

Because most people can’t be logged in around the clock, what you play is only a small portion of your character’s actual life. The rest happens %xhOff-Camera%xn. Most games won't do anything drastic to you when you're not online, but sometimes you will have to work with other players to sort out things that your character was doing while you were away.  

Time during a scene is a more flexible, because characters act faster than their players can //type// their actions. A big fight scene may span several hours OOCly but only represent a few minutes ICly. Likewise, players can gloss over time passing in mid-scene, for example, hand-waving a long ride into town. In this regard, MUSHes are a lot like tabletop RPGs.

Use the %xcictime%xn command to see what day it is in the game world.
