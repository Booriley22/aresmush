Many commands have options.  Throughout the help files, the <> brackets are used to describe the %xharguments%xn - supplemental information you can specify.

    %xcquit%xn - The quit command takes no arguments.
    %xcmail <recipients>=<subject>/<message>%xn - The mail command takes several.
    
Some commands have different modes, called %xhswitches%xn, which you specify with a slash (/).  The base command stays the same, but the switch lets you use it in different ways.  For example:

    %xcoutfit/create <name>%xn - Creates an outfit
    %xcoutfit/delete <name>%xn - Deletes an outfit
    
Commands that show multiple pages of data will have a "page 1 of 4" style footer at the bottom telling you there are more pages available.  You can access those pages simply by putting the page number after the commands.
