Ares does not have generic objects - like @created rings occupying peoples' inventories or signs left in rooms.  Those sorts of things are handled in other ways. 

One of those ways is the details system.  You can add details to yourself or rooms you own, which store supplemental description information.

%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn 

    Type: %xcdetail/set me/ring=A beautiful gold ring.%xn to add a detail to yourself.
    Type: %xclook%xn to see how that details hows in your desc.
    Type: %xclook me/ring%xn to see the detailed description.
    Type: %xcdetail/delete ring%xn to get rid of it.
