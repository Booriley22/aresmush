Handles bring a little taste of social media to MUSHing. A handle is your OOC identity, used across all Ares games. Through your handle, people can identify you as a player, not just as a character.

Handles have an @-sign in front to distinguish them from regular player names, like @Faraday.

There are some MU sub-communities where the players all know each other, and we’ve all seen posts like “Looking for SoAndSo from SuchAndSuchMUSH.” Games close, people drift.

Handles provide tools to help you keep in touch with your friends, and keep track of who’s who.

Having a handle enables a lot of features.  Some of them may make you say, "OMG I don't want people to know this about me!"  Don't worry.  The handles system is completely optional, and there are a variety of privacy and friends settings to help you control who sees what.
