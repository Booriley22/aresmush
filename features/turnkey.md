Setting up an Ares server is designed to be a simple and painless process.  There is no code to compile and no softcode to install.  

The basic Ares installation includes not only the server itself (like Penn and Tiny) but also a rich suite of [Plugins]({{site.siteroot}}features/plugins.html).  The standard plugins cover everything from channels to chargen, so you should have everything you need for a typical game.

Best of all - you don't need a coder to get Ares up and running.  Basic configuration is all done through simple text files.  Just install, edit, and go.

See the [tutorials]({{site.siteroot}}tutorials) for more installation help.
