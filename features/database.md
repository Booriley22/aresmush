Ares uses [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com), which is an up-and-coming database system.  Using a standard database makes it easy to get at your data, make backups, or even integrate it with a website.

*Ares currently offers only read-only access for external sources like websites.  Someday there will be support for changing data as well.*
