To get past the login screen, you need a character.  There are a number of 'guest' characters available that you can borrow just to log in and look around.  To use one of them, type:

    %xctour%xn

Also from the login screen, you can create a new character or connect to an existing one.  Names will normally be your character's first or last name, and can only be a single word.  You should take care to consider the game's theme when choosing your name.  

    %xccreate <name> <password>%xn
    %xcconnect <name> <password>%xn

You can change your password at any time.  If you ever forget your password, use the 'tour' command and contact the admins.
  
    %xcpassword <oldpassword>=<newpassword>%xn - Changes your password.

When you're done, you can quit.

    %xcquit%xn - Disconnects from the game.
