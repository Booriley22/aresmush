If you're in an interior room (defined as one with an "O" out exit), you can lock and unlock the outside door (i.e. the one leading INTO the room from the outside) for privacy.

    %xclock%xn
    %xcunlock%xn

Builders can also lock exits to a list of roles - for instance if you had a "rebel" role you could lock a secret rebel exit to "rebel admin" so only rebels and admins could use it.

    %xclock <exit>=<list of roles who are allowed in>%xn
    %xcunlock <exit>%xn
