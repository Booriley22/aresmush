The MUSH help system is here to help you learn how to play.  

    %xchelp%xn - Lists help topics.
    %xchelp <topic name>%xn - Views a help topic.
    
Some games have additional help libraries, like for admins or builders.  You'll see a list on the main help display, and can access those libraries similarly to how you access the main help.  For example, admin help is:

    %xcahelp%xn - Lists admin help topics
    %xcahelp <topic name>%xn - Views an admin help topic.
