The %xhsheet%xn command lets you view your character sheet.  This contains your character profile, abilities and background.

You may also view other character's sheets, but the game settings will determine how much information you are allowed to see.

    %xcsheet%xn - Views your own sheet.
    %xcsheet <name>%xn - Views someone else's sheet.
