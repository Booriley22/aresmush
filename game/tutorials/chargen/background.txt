The most important part of a character is their background. We are not looking for a novel, just a couple paragraphs describing the characterâ€™s backstory.  In particular, your background should cover:
    
* Who is your character?
* Why are they here?
* Anything noteworthy about your character, particularly things that could serve as RP hooks.
