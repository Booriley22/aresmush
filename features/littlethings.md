Ares tries to make players' lives easier.  Most of these are little conveniences, but hopefully they add up to a more pleasurable experience overall.  

* Reply to the last bbpost you read.
* Command output is prefixed with '%%' so you can easily strip it out of logs.
* Teleport to a person or place by name or ID.
* mail/new that works similar to 'bbnew' to read new mail messages one by one.
* Edit commands (like desc/edit) that grab text easily into your client's input buffer.
* A save/recall command to stash a pose you're working on to answer a page or some other distraction.
* Insert blank lines or other text between poses to track them more easily.
* Automatic and customizable idle messages in rooms and pages when you go AFK.
* *More coming eventually*
