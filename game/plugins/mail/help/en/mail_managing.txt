You can delete mail messages.  Technically this doesn't delete it right away, but tags it as trash.  Messages tagged as trash are deleted when you log out.

    %xcmail/delete <#> or <start#>-<end#>%xn - Sends a message to the trash.
    %xcmail/undelete <#>%xn - Recovers a message from the trash.
    %xcmail/emptytrash%xn - Permanently deletes messages in the trash.
    
You can backup your mail before deleting it.

    %xcmail/backup%xn - Prints out your mail, which you can save to a log file.
