On Penn or Tiny, command names have historical significance.  But new players are sometimes baffled by why it's +finger vs @desc, or why there's a difference between +who and WHO.  On Ares, commands are intended to be more intuitive and consistent.  

# Oh no, not another set of commands!

Don't worry if you're an experienced MUSH player.  Thanks to the [Shortcuts]({{site.siteroot}}features/shortcuts.html) system, you'll find that the command names you know and love should work just fine.  In fact, Ares does its best to support **both** Penn and MUX syntax for common commands.

# No Prefixes

Commands in Ares have no prefixes.  The who command is simply "who".  The combat command is simply "combat".  If you do accidentally type a prefix (@, +, or /), it'll be ignored, so +who, @who and /who all end up being just "who".  

*Channels and exits are an exception to the 'no prefix' rule.*

# Intuitive Names

Commands in Ares have (hopefully) intuitive names.  The OOC profile commad is 'profile', not 'finger'.  The command to build a room is 'build', not 'dig'.  The [Shortcuts]({{site.siteroot}}features/shortcuts.html) system provides aliases for the old-school command names.
