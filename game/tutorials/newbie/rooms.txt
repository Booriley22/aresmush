Poses are not visible to everyone on the game; only people in the same room can see them.  But wait -- what's a room?

The MUSH has a game world, sometimes called the %xhGrid%xn.  The world is made up of %xhRooms%xn linked by %xhExits%xn. "Room" in this sense is not to be taken literally.  Going back to our TV analogy, it would be better to think of them as locations or sets.  Some are, in fact, //rooms// ("Living Room", "Cafeteria") but a MUSH "room" can represent anything from a star system to a closet.  The room name and description will give you an idea of what each room represents.  

Note: Just because you can see something going on in your room doesn’t necessarily mean your //character// can see it. If the room represents an entire saloon, a character sitting at the bar wouldn’t be able to hear a quiet conversation at a private table.  Pay attention to poses to see where people are.

You can see the name and description of your current room simply by typing %xclook%xn.  This will also show you other players who are in the room with you, and exits to other places you can go from here.  To go through an exit, you type the letter in brackets that's in front of the name.  For example:

    %xh[C]   Carpenter's Shop%xn   <<--- typing "C" would take you into the carpenter's shop.

%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn 
    Type: %xclook%xn
    Go through one of the exits.
