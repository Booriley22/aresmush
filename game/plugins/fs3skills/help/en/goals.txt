To help you flesh out your character, FS3 requres you to set Goals and RP Hooks.

You should list at least one Goal, preferably something that will drive your character in RP.  Are they looking for a job?  Wanting to open their own business?  Hoping to avenge their father's murder?   It doesn't need to be a novel - a sentence or so is fine.

You should also list at least one RP Hook - something interesting about your character that others can "hook" into for RP. This could be an odd personality quirk, a reputation your character has, or anything else that might inspire someone to connect with you.  Looking around at other character's sheets can be a good way to get inspiration for RP Hooks.  Again - this doesn't need to be elaborate.

RP Hooks and Goals are freeform text. You can use ansi codes and \%r linebreaks.
