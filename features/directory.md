Ares supports a number of cross-game features, including an AresMUSH games directory.  This list will tell you all the AresMUSH games that have registered with the central server.  It lists the game genre, description, and the last time it was online.  Someday there may be other cross-game features, like cross-game who, pages, and more (anyone remember MUDBot?).
