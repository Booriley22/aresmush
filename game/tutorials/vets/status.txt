Your IC/OOC status is controlled solely by what room you're in.  Rooms tagged as OOC areas show your status as OOC; rooms tagged as IC areas show your status as IC.

To get between the IC and OOC grids, you use the %xconstage%xn and %xcoffstage%xn commands.

AFK status is just a flag; you can set it no matter where you are and it doesn't take you to a special room or anything.  You can also set a custom AFK message, which shows up in room descs and also in pages.  %xcafk Getting dinner - be back around 8pm EST%xn.  The system will also automatically indicate that you're afk in room descs and pages if you've been idle for a very long time.
 
%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn 
    Type: %xcafk <message>%xn to set yourself AFK.
    Type: %xcoffstage%xn to unset the AFK status and hop back to the main offstage room.
