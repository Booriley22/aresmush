Details can be used to keep more detailed views separate from the main description.  For example, if your character has a ring, you might create a really detailed description of that ring and put it in a "Ring" detail.  You could also do this for signs, notes, and other landmarks in rooms.  Details take the place of desc-placeholder objects that one might find in other MUSH servers.

    %xcdetail/set <name>/<detail title>=<description>%xn
    %xcdetail/delete <name>/<detail title>%xn
    %xcdetail/edit <name>/<detail title>%xn - Grabs the existing detail into your input 
       buffer (if your client supports it.  See %xhhelp edit%xn.)
       
You view details using the regular look command:

   %xclook <name>/<detail title>%xn - Looks at a detail on something.
