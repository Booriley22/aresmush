Ares does not have an @decompile like Penn and Tiny because the way it stores data is completely different.  But there are other tools you can use instead.

For character backups there's the %xcbackup%xn command, which will dump out your character sheet, background, description and multi-desc outfits.  You can log this to a file. There's a separate %xcmail/backup%xn command for your mail.

Want to make a change to your desc?  Use %xcdesc/edit%xn to grab a copy of your current desc into your client's input buffer (the place where you type).  This only works on some clients and may require configuration - see %xhhelp edit%xn for details.
 
%xh-- Give it a try! --%xn 
    Set up the edit parameters for your client according to the instructions in %xchelp edit%xn
    Type: %xcdesc me=A coder type person.%xn
    Type: %xcdesc/edit%xn to grab your current desc into your input buffer.
