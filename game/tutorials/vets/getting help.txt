The main Ares help system is accessed through the %xhHelp System%xn (type %xchelp%xn).  What's different is that help topics are organized by category, hopefully making it easier to find what you're looking for.  There is no help vs +help distinction, although there are other help libraries (like ahelp for admins or bhelp for builders).

For a few major topics - like this one - interactive help can be found in the %xhTutorials System%xn (see %xchelp tutorials%xn).

Throughout the Ares help files and tutorials, %xclight blue%xn text indicates commands you type.
